# Ecommerce Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project is a complete Ecommerce Data Analytics pipeline built using Python and MySQL. The analysis is performed on ecommerce data sourced from 7 CSV files, covering customers, orders, products, sellers, payments, and more.

The project uses:

Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization

MySQL for structured storage and querying

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mysql‑connector for implementation

Features & Workflow
1. Data Loading & Preparation

Importing all 7 CSV files into Python using Pandas

Cleaning, formatting, and transforming fields

Pushing cleaned data into MySQL tables via mysql‑connector

2. Analysis Performed

The project answers several real-world ecommerce analytics questions, grouped into three levels:

Basic Analysis

Unique cities where customers are located

Moving average of order values for each customer

Cumulative monthly sales for each year

Year‑over‑year (YoY) sales growth

6‑month customer retention analysis

Top 3 highest‑spending customers per year

Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mysql‑connector

MySQL: Database storage and querying

Jupyter Notebook / Scripts: For running analysis end‑to‑end

Outputs
